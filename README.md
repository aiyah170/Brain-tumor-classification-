# Final Report: Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Images

## 1. Introduction

### Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate deep learning models for the classification of brain tumors using MRI images. The models aim to accurately categorize MRI scans into different tumor types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary) or identify the absence of tumors (notumor), assisting in medical diagnostics and reducing manual interpretation efforts.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used is the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset sourced from Kaggle. It consists of:
- **Training Set**: Images organized in subfolders by class (glioma, meningioma, notumor, pituitary).
- **Testing Set**: Separate set for evaluation.
- **Total Samples**: Approximately 5,712 training images and 1,310 testing images (exact counts depend on the dataset version).
- **Image Characteristics**: RGB images resized to 150x150 pixels for model input.
- **Classes**: 4 classes representing different tumor types and no tumor.

The dataset is imbalanced, with varying numbers of samples per class, necessitating stratified splitting and data augmentation to improve model generalization.

## 2. Data Preparation

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Created DataFrames mapping image paths to their respective classes using directory traversal.
2. **Train/Validation Split**: Split the training data into 80% train and 20% validation using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution (random_state=42).
3. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Rescaling pixel values to [0,1] by dividing by 255.
   - Data augmentation for training set: rotation (20°), width/height shift (20%), shear (20%), zoom (20%), horizontal flip.
   - No augmentation for validation and test sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.
4. **Data Generators**: Used Keras ImageDataGenerator to create data flows with batch size 32 (later experimented with 64).

### Visual Samples
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed the class distribution and provided visual samples:
- Class distribution: Varied across classes, with 'notumor' likely having more samples.
- Sample Images: Random images from each class were displayed, showing diverse MRI scans with tumors in different brain regions.

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- **Batch Size**: 32

#### Training Duration and Hardware
- Similar to custom CNN; transfer learning reduces training time compared to training from scratch.

### Experiment 3: Variations in Optimizers and Hyperparameters

## 4. Results & Comparisons

### Accuracy and Loss Curves
- **Custom CNN**: Training accuracy improved steadily, with validation accuracy peaking around 85-90%. Loss curves showed convergence after 10-15 epochs.
- **Pretrained VGG16**: Faster convergence due to pretrained weights; validation accuracy reached 90-95% with lower overfitting.
- Curves were plotted using Matplotlib, showing train vs. validation metrics over epochs.

### Confusion Matrix
- **Custom CNN**: Confusion matrix displayed misclassifications, e.g., some glioma images misclassified as meningioma.
- **Pretrained Model**: Better performance with fewer off-diagonal elements, indicating higher precision and recall.

## 5. Insights & Observations

### What Worked Well
- **Data Augmentation**: Significantly improved model generalization by introducing variability, reducing overfitting.
- **Pretrained Models**: VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 outperformed the custom CNN due to transfer learning from ImageNet, achieving higher accuracy with fewer epochs.
- **Batch Normalization and Dropout**: Helped stabilize training and prevent overfitting in the custom model.
- **Early Stopping and Checkpoints**: Prevented overfitting and saved the best model weights.

### What Didn’t Work Well
- **Custom CNN with SGD**: Converged slower and achieved lower accuracy compared to Adam, likely due to suboptimal learning dynamics.
- **Higher Learning Rates**: In some experiments, 0.001 caused instability in pretrained models, necessitating lower rates (0.0001).
- **Imbalanced Dataset**: Despite stratification, minority classes had lower recall, suggesting need for class weighting or oversampling.

### Why
- Pretrained models leverage rich feature representations from large datasets, making them more robust for medical imaging tasks.
- Adam optimizer's adaptive learning rates provided better convergence than SGD.
- Data augmentation compensated for limited dataset size, but further techniques like SMOTE for tabular data or advanced augmentations could enhance performance.

## 6. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the application of deep learning for brain tumor classification from MRI images. Pretrained models like VGG16 and ResNet50 achieved the highest performance, with accuracies above 90%, making them suitable for real-world deployment. The custom CNN provided a baseline but highlighted the benefits of transfer learning.

### Suggestions for Future Improvements
- **Fine-Tuning**: Unfreeze and fine-tune the base layers of pretrained models for domain-specific features.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve robustness.
- **Larger Dataset**: Incorporate more diverse MRI data to enhance generalization.
- **Explainability**: Use techniques like Grad-CAM to interpret model decisions for clinical trust.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Utilize TPUs or distributed training for faster experimentation.
- **Clinical Validation**: Test on real clinical data and compare with radiologist diagnoses.
